===========================

[✔] Model: YOLOv8n

[🟢 PHASE 1]
- Trained on WIDERFACE for 100 epochs
- Initial baseline

[🟢 PHASE 2]
- Extended to 300 epochs (same WIDERFACE dataset)
- Used as base model checkpoint for future training

[📂 Datasets Used]
- WIDERFACE (Base): http://shuoyang1213.me/WIDERFACE
- FDDB (Fine-tuning): https://universe.roboflow.com/fddb/face-detection-40nq0/dataset/1/download
- DARKFACE (Low-light): https://universe.roboflow.com/school-g4vy0/dark_face_detection/dataset/1
- MAFA (Masked faces): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/revanthrex/mafadataset

[📌 Notes]
- Base model ready for fine-tuning using FDDB, DARKFACE, MAFA.
- Use `--resume` or `--weights` flag in YOLOv8 CLI to continue training.
